[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s).
# You can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,)
# or put this option multiple times (only on the command line, 
# not in the configuration file where it should appear only once).
#
# You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks.
#
# For example, if you want to run only the similarities checker,
# you can use "--disable=all --enable=similarities". 
#
# If you want to run only the classes checker, but have no Warning level messages displayed,
# use "--disable=all --enable=classes --disable=W".
